# ta-yang
Textadept language module to edit YANG RFC6020 files

Clone this repository into your $home/.textadept directory and add the following line into your $HOME/.textadept/init.lua file
```
textadept.file_types.extensions.yang = 'yang'
```
This is still extremely rudimentary and has a lot of TODOs
